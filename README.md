🎉 Snowy Bots: Lite & Extra 🎉
Welcome to the Snowy Bots repository! Here, you will find two Discord bots designed to enhance your server with some cool functionalities. Whether you want to manage roles or engage in fun economy-based interactions, these bots have you covered. Let's dive into what each bot does! 👇

❄️ Snowy Lite Bot

The Snowy Lite bot is your go-to for simple and effective role management. Here's what it can do:

Features
Prefix Management:
/setprefix: Allows you to set a prefix for all members with a specific role. Just choose the role and prefix, and Snowy Lite will handle the rest! 🏷️
/removeprefix: Removes the prefix from all members with the chosen role, making it super easy to manage your server's appearance. 🚫
How It Works
When the bot is online, it will automatically sync with your server to ensure all commands are ready to use.
You can set or remove prefixes for any role, and the bot will update the nicknames of all members with that role.

🌟 Snowy Extra Bot

Snowy Extra is the powerhouse bot with an integrated economy system. Whether you want to play, manage your virtual wealth, or challenge friends, this bot is packed with features!

Features
Economy Commands:

/balance: Check how many Snowflakes you have! ❄️
/bank [amount]: Deposit your Snowflakes into your bank for safekeeping. 🏦
/rob [user]: Feeling a bit mischievous? Rob another user for a chance to gain some extra Snowflakes. 🤫
/tip [user] [amount]: Generously tip your fellow server members with some of your Snowflakes. 💸
/duel [user] [amount]: Challenge another user to a duel! Winner takes all. ⚔️
/loan [amount]: Need some extra Snowflakes? Take out a loan (just make sure to repay it in time!). 💰
Loan Management:

The bot periodically checks for overdue loans and keeps track of users' financial activities, ensuring the economy stays balanced. 📊
How It Works
On startup, Snowy Extra syncs its commands with your server and starts monitoring loans.
You can manage your Snowflakes, challenge friends, and even borrow money, all within the server!
The bot logs all actions, helping you keep track of everything that's happening. 📝
